NO - single table with rowspan and colspan:
    1. will not support sorting within a sub-table (no subtables exist)
    2. adding/removing will be difficult (having to maintain the correct spans)

MAYBE - UL/LI with dynamic height:
    1. difficult to implement css with display: table-row, table-cell
    2. Same behavior as a normal table (can't use colspan and the mismatching cols are trimmed)

MAYBE - Nested tables
    1. CSS of subtables is difficult
